# drawCircle.cpp
This program draws a circle in the console.
You can draw a circle of the radius that you want.
Note1:The circle is not 100% accurate because we are dealing with the circle function f(x) = sqrt(radius² - x²) and gives numbers with lots of decimals, so the circle 
is not 100% accurate.
Note 2:
If you modify a little the code you can graph any function in the console.
